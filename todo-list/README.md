TAMID APPLICATION

Once the folder is downloaded, run the following commands in your terminal in order for it to start:

    npm install //this will install your node_modules folder

    npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000 //this will enable your json  server

    npm start //this will start the app

The app has two items in its navBar: home and starred. 

The starred section is not working yet, but I added it so it can be implemented in the future.
